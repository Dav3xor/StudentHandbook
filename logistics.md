## Blocks + Scheduling

You are always welcome to use NedSpace to work, and we may have some time to say hi and even help a bit, your main learning work is scheduled in blocks. You have an allocation of blocks per week based on your status. See the structure on the website here.

A block is a three hour period. One of our staff members will be "on deck" to support learning during the block.

We need to know when people are planning to be in, and which blocks they plan to use so we can be prepared to support your learning. We may also need to cap the number of supported students per block.

When your block begins there will be a kickoff, new students will be introduced, and everyone will cover:

* what they have been working on, including any successes
* what they plan to work on next
* if there are any blockers they might need help with
* How confident they are feeling

This is a good time to find people to pair up with. Group projects will get together at this time. They may have a separate kickoff.

New students are a priority, and staff will spend some one-on-one time to create a personalize learning plan.

Other students will start their learning. As you work, you may have questions, or need some help with your project. Put your name on the queue to let the staff know you are looking for some mentoring. The queue system (which is as simple as names and questions on a whiteboard at this point) helps us make sure we get to everyone regularly. If one staff member is supporting many students, we may have as little as 10 minutes per student in a block, but day to day this will vary.

Mentors aren't your only source of learning! You will learn more about other procedures, but they boil down to re-examining your problem, searching for more information, and asking peers before going to a mentor. Also, as you learn more, you will spend time helping your peers learn. You may be able to work on clearing the queue ahead of you.

The gaps between blocks give us explicit time to take breaks, relax, eat lunch, and have some fun. Sometimes an event or activity may be planned for a gap, such as a sponsored lunch with a tech company. These should not be the only breaks you take! Changes of pace, getting up and stretching, or going for a walk are some great options. Don't try to "push through" too much, the breaks are a chance to reflect, and for processing your learning. Breaks can be as important as "working" to the learning process.
