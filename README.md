PDX Code Guild Student Handbook
===============

Hello learner, and welcome to the PDX Code Guild! This handbook is designed to help you start your learning adventure.

You're here for any number of reasons, our students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and to pursue a wide variety of goals. The thing we have in common is that we all want to become better developers.

The PDX Code Guild is an experiential learning community building software careers. 

We could use a good motto, a catchy mission statement, something about doing and learning and making mistakes, building things, changing the world. But we're really new right now, and we're in our experiential phase. Help us build great things!
